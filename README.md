Free your mind and imagine how many cool things you could build on your own with Stelace API…
From online marketplaces to real-time platforms.

A more classical [marketplace starter kit](https://github.com/stelace/marketplace-demo) is also available with additional marketplace features such as Ratings, real-time Messaging, Asset pages and Transactions.

## Make it your own

You first need to get your Stelace API keys. Good news: [it’s free](https://github.com/stelace/stelace).

1. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stelace/heroes-platform-demo.git
cd heroes-platform-demo
```

2. Install node_modules

```sh
# using yarn instead of npm is recommended
yarn
```

> If you don’t have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed, you can follow these [instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install).

3. Create environment files for development and production.

You can copy `.env.example` and fill it with Stelace API keys.

```sh
cp .env.example .env.development
# You may want to use live Stelace API keys in this file
cp .env.example .env.production
```

You need to fill the following environment variables:

- STELACE_*PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY (pubk_*...) used in Vue app
- STELACE_*SECRET_API_KEY (seck_*...) used in data seeding scripts
- VUE_APP_MAPBOX_STYLE to activate the map. You can upload live demo [dark map style](/map/darknyc.json) with [Maptiler](
  https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/
) and get a [map style URL](
  https://cloud.maptiler.com/maps/upload
): `https://api.maptiler.com/maps/YOUR_MAP_STYLE_ID/style.json?key=MAPTILER_KEY`.

You can get your API Keys in [Stelace Dashboard](https://stelace.com/dashboard).

4. Seed [data](./docs/development-data.md) and [workflows](https://stelace.com/docs/command/workflows).

```sh
yarn seed
```

5. Start front-end development server

```sh
yarn dev
# same as quasar dev
```

Please refer to [Quasar docs](https://v1.quasar-framework.org/) for more details about configuration and info on components.

Enjoy your platform :)
