        ## Stelace Backend: starting with your Assets

        This starter kit runs on [Stelace Backend API](https://stelace.com)
        to let you [build platforms in days](https://stelace.com/blog/building-a-real-time-web-platform-from-scratch-in-one-week/).

        Your platform [Assets](https://stelace.com/docs/assets) can be _anything_
        you want your [Users](https://stelace.com/docs/users) to find using
        [Search](https://stelace.com/docs/search):
        cars, houses, freelancers, events…

        ## Build any type of marketplace with Stelace API

        It’s really easy to build a two-sided marketplace where
        [Users](https://stelace.com/docs/users) can create [Assets](https://stelace.com/docs/assets).

        Stelace also includes [Messages](https://stelace.com/docs/messages),
        [Ratings](https://stelace.com/docs/ratings)
        and [Transactions](https://stelace.com/docs/transactions) APIs to run any type of platform.

        ## Search API

        Stelace API provides a powerful typo-tolerant [Search](https://stelace.com/docs/search)
        with time-based [availability](https://stelace.com/docs/search/availability) support
        and advanced [filters](https://stelace.com/docs/search#filtering).

        _Hint: Try searching `風の谷` or `Supermxx`._

        ## Event API, Workflows and integrations

        Flagging in this demo is another example of simple yet powerful serverless logic
        for your platform using Stelace [Workflows](https://stelace.com/docs/command/workflows):

        1. A [custom Event](https://stelace.com/docs/command/events) is sent

        2. A Workflow increments the number of flags for this
        [Asset](https://stelace.com/docs/assets) and deactivates it once
        a given number of flags has been reached.

        3. Stelace staff gets notified on Slack in last Workflow step.

        ![Heroes Demo Hero flag notification on Slack](

        ## Stelace API: Automation and real-time

        With custom [Events](https://stelace.com/docs/command/events) you can enable any scenario
        on your platform using powerful [Workflows](https://stelace.com/docs/command/workflows).


        [Signal API](https://stelace.com/docs/signal) lets you notify all your users or specific _channels_
        in real-time. That’s how each hero Asset location and status are updated live on the map.

        _Hint: Try using the app with several devices/browsers to test live updates ;)_
