# Stelace Super Heroes Demo

Here is a short description of what is implemented in this platform starter kit featuring Stelace [Search (Docs)](https://stelace.com/docs/search/), [Command](https://stelace.com/docs/command/) and some [Instant](https://stelace.com/docs) APIs.

## Web platform UI

- Typo-tolerant full-text [Search](https://stelace.com/docs/search/) of hero [Assets](
  https://stelace.com/docs/assets/)
- Advanced filters with [Custom Attributes](https://stelace.com/docs/assets/custom-attributes)
- NY Map location and mission status updated in real-time with custom [Events](
  https://stelace.com/docs/command/events) and [Signal](https://stelace.com/docs/signal).

### User actions

- When clicking a hero search result card, show a dialog with a button to book a hero for 1 hour in live demo version, starting from now.
The hero is then marked as busy and wonâ€™t get any new assignment for the duration of current mission.
- Users can create their own heroes after authentication relying on [User API](https://stelace.com/docs/users).

## Workflows/Tasks for each superhero

- Random short mission assignments depending on [Tasks](https://stelace.com/docs/command/tasks) triggering every minute, and longer manual missions assigned by visitors.
- Self-destruction after 48 hours for heroes created by visitors.
- Asset flagging and Slack notification to staff
